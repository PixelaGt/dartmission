Why is called dartmission? Well, we have some inspiration:

## Double Asteroid Redirection Test
The **D**ouble **A**steroid **R**edirection **T**est is a is a NASA space mission aimed at testing a method of planetary defense against near-Earth objects.

## What is this about?
The game is simple, you need to help the spaceman (codename Pixman, because there's only one Bowie) to reach his final goal. We know there are a lot of challenges out there in space, like running out of oxygen, so you need to be quick to help our spaceman to find the right path to reach the destination. Every challenge is harder than the previous one, think carefully the movements you're going to do.
